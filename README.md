# CodeDeltaIndex
The novel delta index calcuates the uncertainties associated with the dose accumulation process. 

The provided script calculates the delta index, which is determined by the spatial uncertainty of the Deformable Image Registration (the Distance Discordance Metric) and local dose differences.
The results consists of the delta index distribution and the delta index passing rate.
