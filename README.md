# CodeDeltaIndex
The novel delta index calcuates the uncertainties associated with cumulative dose distributions. 
The uncertainties arose from the challanges of the Deformable Image Registration used to accumulate the dose. 
The provided script calculates the delta index using the accumulated dose distribution and a spatial uncertainty of the uncerrtainty of the Deformable Image Registration, the Distance Discordance Metric (DDM).

The results consists of the delta index distribution and the delta index passing rate.
